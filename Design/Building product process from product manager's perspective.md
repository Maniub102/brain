# Building Process from Product Manager's Perspective

### Project management triangle

The project management triangle is a model of the constraints of project management. Throughout a project, there are three things that a project manager concerns about:

- Scope: what must be done to produce the project's end result
- Budget: the budgeted amount available for the project
- Time: the amount of time available to complete a project.

The **quality** of work is constrained by these three constraints, if there is any change in one constraint, the quality will suffer. In fact, not every stakeholder/client defines the right problem and solution at the beginning, a project manager must be able to manage these constraints to minimize risks.


### Project management process

Typically, the project management process has 5 phases, work process of the designer and developer covered only in 2 phases execution and control. PM has to have a broader view, from brainstorming with CEO/stakeholders and collecting requirements, forming a product team and transferring all the insight, brief to the team; to tracking and managing the triangle constraints, negotiating with the business team to make sure that the project will be launched on time. To initiate a new project, the project manager sits down with the founder and other stakeholders to receive requirements, defines the Objectives, Stakeholders, Users, Decision-makers and how things will be carried out. Then, he documents all information into a **project charter**. It is a crucial ingredient in planning out the project because it is used throughout the project lifecycle.After that, he might conduct a **feasibility study** to evaluate the problem and solution provided by clients, measure the feasibility of the project based on factors such as: market, legal, cost, technical, organization, schedule,...In the planning phase, the project requirements are analyzed further in detail and break down into smaller tasks (**Work Breakdown Structure**). Team members are assigned to roles and responsibilities and to all of the works that need to be done. All tasks will be put on the Gantt chart (or any tool we decide to use) to track scope and progress. Other tools might be used to track time and cost as well. However, in the early stage of a startup, they don't usually spend too much on budget tracking due to time, resources and cost limited.Overall, becoming a project manager requires many skills, qualities and broad knowledge in multiple domains. Usually, the product designer doesn't have a chance to meet up with the founder/CEO because of a lack of insight knowledge and credibility. If we cultivate a sufficient amount of knowledge and participate in the brainstorming/planning meeting with stakeholders, we can directly get insight and hear about their story and incentive to make the decision, the design will be able to meet the requirements and expectations.
