In web3 industry,  we like to keep things simple and sexy, so I will introduce you the Triple S of UX in web3

## Simple

**Sample**
An intuitive and convenient login method.

## Self-custodial

Ensure design communicates the empowerment users should have; allow them to benefit from the decentralized ecosystem.

**Sample**
Web3Auth Key Infrastructure ensures users can recover their accounts and no one entity can restrict access to their assets.
