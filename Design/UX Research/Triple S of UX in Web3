For most users in Web3 not excepting me, they are exposed to the tip of the iceberg which got them interested in space like Bitcoin, Defi, and NFT - these are simple terms that people know but when they dig deeper it's actually a whole lot term like "Gas Fees", "Private Key", "Public address",... It's not very user-friendly and people just give up halfway when you ask them about private key or others. So we want a familiar easy to understand way for users, I compose the Triple S of UX to make web3 accessible.

## Simple

Familiar, easy-to-understand method for users to onboard and get started, and interact with decentralized applications.

**Sample**
An intuitive and convenient login method.

## Secure

Give users the security assurance from start to end, as required.

**Sample**
Enable 2-factor authentication to increase the trust that users place on providers to safeguard their assets.

## Self-custodial

Ensure design communicates the empowerment users should have; allow them to benefit from the decentralized ecosystem.

**Sample**
Web3Auth Key Infrastructure ensures users can recover their accounts and no one entity can restrict access to their assets.
