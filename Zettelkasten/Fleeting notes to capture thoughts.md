#  Fleeting Notes to Capture Thoughts

The goal of fleeting notes are to **capture thoughts** on the go, using any capture method.

- Fleeting notes need to be absolutely painless, short and spontaneous. It's just a starting point for growing a new idea and a reminder of thoughts you couldn't processed yet. 
- Fleeting notes aim to be deleted within the 2 or 3 days once they were written. Though, they must be deleted especialy if you can't recall the context anymore, make no sense or became banal. 
- Fleeting note don't need to be written with destination or purpose. The usage and the purpose of a fleeting note can and will be decide later, once it will become a Permanent note
- **Fleeting notes has to be reviewed everyday**. This is an habit to take in order to have a performant zettelkasten system. By reviewed, I mean tagged, processed, reformulated and connected to Literature note in order to create Permanent note.
- Fleeting notes must all be formatted the same to be reviewed easier.

"Fleeting notes" refer to the scraps of notes we take while reading or thinking via some ubiquitous capture method (digital or analog). 

These are the raw material of ideas. They don't serve much purpose on their own but to act as reminders. Put them in an inbox to be processed later—but not too much later. If there's too much of a delay between capturing the fleeting notes and when we process them, we may forget information we wanted to keep.

Don't copy fleeting notes verbatim; translating them into other words helps better understand the content whereas copying quotations word for word may actually alter their meaning by ripping them out of their context. (See [[Writing is thinking]])

Forms of capture like highlighting or underlining passages in a book and marginalia are all kinds of fleeting notes.

Because fleeting notes are reminders, they can be trashed after they've been processed.
